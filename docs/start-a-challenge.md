# Start a Challenge

The setup process is the same for all challenges. Fork
the [Open Ecosystem Challenges repository](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/open-ecosystem-challenges), start a
Codespace with
your challenge's configuration, and wait for the infrastructure to deploy.

## 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the GitHub repo or
use [this link](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/open-ecosystem-challenges/fork).

### Already Have a Fork?

If you've completed a previous challenge and already have a fork, sync it first to get the latest updates:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click **Sync fork** (above the file list)
3. Click **Update branch** if changes are available

This ensures you have the latest challenge content before starting a new level.

## 2. Start a Codespace

- From your fork, click the green **Code** button → **Codespaces hamburger menu** → **New with options**

- Select the configuration that matches your challenge (e.g., "Adventure 01 | 🟢 Beginner (Broken Echoes)" for the
  beginner level of adventure 1)
  ![Codespace options](./images/codespace-options.png)

> ⚠️ **Important:** The challenge will not work if you choose a configuration that does not match your challenge (or the
> default).
## 3. Wait for Infrastructure to Deploy

Your Codespace will automatically provision all necessary challenge infrastructure. This usually takes around 5-10
minutes.

> 💡 **Tip:** To check the progress press `Cmd + Shift + P` (or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux) and search for
`View Creation Log` (available after a few moments once the Codespace has initialized).

Once complete, return to your specific challenge documentation for level-specific instructions on solving the challenge.
