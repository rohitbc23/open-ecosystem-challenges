# 🌆️ Adventure 02: Building CloudHaven

Welcome to the second adventure in the **Open Ecosystem Challenge** series!  
Your mission: modernize CloudHaven's infrastructure from manual provisioning to a self-service platform.  
This is a hands-on journey through **OpenTofu**, **Crossplane**, and **Platform Engineering**.

The entire **infrastructure is pre-provisioned in your Codespace** — OpenTofu, a Kubernetes cluster, Crossplane, and mock
cloud services are ready to go.  
**You don't need to set up anything locally. Just focus on solving the problem.**
