# 🌆️ Adventure 02: Building CloudHaven

Welcome to the second adventure in the **Open Ecosystem Challenge** series!  
Your mission: modernize CloudHaven's infrastructure from manual provisioning to a self-service platform.  
This is a hands-on journey through infrastructure as code with **OpenTofu** and **GitHub Actions**.

The entire **infrastructure is pre-provisioned in your Codespace** — OpenTofu and mock cloud services are ready to go.  
**You don't need to set up anything locally. Just focus on solving the problem.**
