# 🔭 Adventure 03: The AI Observatory

Welcome to the February adventure in the **Open Ecosystem Challenge** series!
Your mission: investigate a mysterious bandwidth anomaly at a remote research station by instrumenting its AI system.
This is a hands-on journey through **AI Observability** with **OpenTelemetry**, **OpenLLMetry**, and **Jaeger**.

The entire **infrastructure is pre-provisioned in your Codespace** — Kubernetes cluster, Ollama, and observability tools
are ready to go.
**You don't need to set up anything locally. Just focus on solving the problem.**
